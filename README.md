# Banking System Project

## Banking System Development Writen in Java using Servlets Technology
This project is part of a web development course from the Universidad de Cartagena where we use different technologies to solve a problem given by the instructor. In this project, I used Java and Servlets technology to make the server-side of a banking system that has accounts, clients and bank branches. Below, I present the main points developed in this project: 

* Analysis of the functional and non-functional requirements of the web application.
* Database modelling to facilitate its implementation. 
* Application of the MVC pattern to organize the code and guarantee its scalability.
* Using the basics of HTML and CSS to create the view
